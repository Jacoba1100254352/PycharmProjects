Use pysynth to build a song generator that asks the user to enter in notes to add to the song!

# Reminder for using psynth:
# 1) You can see the project files by clicking the file icon on the sidebar to the left!
# 2) Do not click on the wav file until the program is finished running (i.e. once you see the blue Run button again instead of the red Stop button)

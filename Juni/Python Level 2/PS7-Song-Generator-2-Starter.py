"""
Use pysynth to build a song generator that asks the user to enter in notes and durations to add to the song! Make sure to use a dictionary in your code (notice that in the demo, the duration is inputted as "whole," "half," etc!
"""

# Reminder for using psynth:
# 1) You can see the project files by clicking the file icon on the sidebar to the left!
# 2) Do not click on the wav file until the program is finished running (i.e. once you see the blue Run button again instead of the red Stop button)

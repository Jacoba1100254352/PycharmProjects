"""
First, create lists containing the following numbers:
The numbers 1 through 20
The first 20 even numbers
The first 10 square numbers (1, 4, 9, etc.)
Once you have created those lists, write the following functions:
A function that takes in two lists and returns the sum of both lists
A function that takes in a list and returns the minimum value in that list
A function that takes in a list and returns the maximum value in that list
A function that takes in a list of lists, and returns the sum of all those lists
A function that takes in a list of lists, and returns a new list made from “flattening” the lists (putting every element from each list into a single list)
A function that takes in a list of lists, and returns a new list containing the maximum value from each of the input lists. Can you find a way to use the function that you already made that returns the maximum of a list?

"""
Welcome to Juni World! In this project, you are given a dictionary with the names of the various rides at Juni World and the amount of time it takes to wait and ride each ride. Park-goers have 6 hours to spend at Juni World on any rides they would like, and they have to start leaving the park once they have 15 minutes remaining or less. Write a program that continuously tells the user how much time they have remaining in Juni World, lets them choose a ride to go on, and prints out all of the rides they went on in order at the end of the day.

"""
When students enroll in their classes for the semester, their names are appended to a list for each class. However, the system mistakenly does not prevent students from enrolling in a class multiple times if they resubmit the form, so several students appear on a class list multiple times. Write a program that, given the lists for each class, prints out the actual number of students enrolled in each class after the duplicates have been removed.

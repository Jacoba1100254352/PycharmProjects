# How do we include the ability to use random numbers into our file:


# What is the difference between an integer and a string? Give an example of both:


# Make a variable which holds a string and another that holds an integer:


# Make a new variable called randomNum which holds a random number between 0-100:


# This is how I draw a triangle with a random color and random size:


# Explain how the above code works:
# 
# Explain how we could also make the triangle we drew appear at random coordinates:
# 

# *bonus* What are two different ways that I could double the range of sizes my triangle could be if I start with sideLength = random.randint(0,50):

"""
A coffee shop keeps an electronic record of the prices of their coffee drinks. Currently, they store the drink and the price in "parallel lists," meaning the first list contains all the drink names, and the second list contains their corresponding prices They just learned about dictionaries, and they think this would be a smarter way of storing the prices. Convert their parallel lists into a dictionary, and then print out their entire menu (i.e. how much each drink costs).
